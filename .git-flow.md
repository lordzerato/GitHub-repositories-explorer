# Git Flow

## Branching Strategy

This project uses a simplified Git flow:

- `main`: Production-ready branch (deployed to production)
- `dev`: Integration branch (used for feature testing and QA)
- `feature/*`: Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bugfix branches
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes applied to production (main)

---

## Workflow

### 1. Creating a feature branch

- Base branch: `main` (if improving an existing feature that is already released)
- Base branch: `dev` (if developing new feature together with other features)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

### 2. Developing in feature branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of new feature"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/feature-name
```

### 3. Merging feature into `dev`

Via GitHub Pull Request (preferred):

- PR from `feature/feature-name` → `dev`
- Squash & merge or merge commit

Or via Sourcetree:

- Checkout `dev`
- Pull latest `dev`
- Right-click feature branch → Merge into `dev`
- Push `dev`

### 4. Merging `dev` into `main` (release)

When `dev` is stable and ready to release:

- PR from `dev` → `main`
- After PR merged, tag release if needed
- Deploy to production

### 5. Handling hotfixes

If there is an urgent fix required on production:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/short-description
```

After fixing:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: description"
git push origin hotfix/short-description
```

- PR from `hotfix/*` → `main`
- After merging to `main`, **ALWAYS merge `main` back to `dev`**:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push origin dev
```

---

## Merge main → dev guideline

**DO NOT use:**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Instead use:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push origin dev
```

This ensures:

- A clear merge commit
- History remains clean
- Avoid unexpected fast-forward or rebase issues

# Sourcetree Flow

## 1. Merging feature into dev

1. Checkout `dev`
2. Pull latest `dev`
3. Right-click `feature/xxx` → Merge into `dev`
4. Push `dev`

## 2. Merging main into dev (after hotfix)

1. Checkout `dev`
2. Pull latest `dev`
3. Right-click `main` → Merge into `dev`
4. Push `dev`

## 3. Merging dev into main (release)

1. Create Pull Request on GitHub: `dev` → `main`
2. Merge using "Merge commit" (preferred) or "Squash and merge"
3. Pull `main` locally if needed

# Commit Convention

| Type     | Usage                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| feat     | New feature                        |
| fix      | Bug fix                            |
| hotfix   | Urgent fix to production           |
| chore    | Maintenance tasks (update deps)    |
| refactor | Code restructuring without feature |
| docs     | Documentation updates              |
| style    | Code formatting, no logic change   |
| test     | Adding or updating tests           |

# Summary

- Features start from `feature/*`
- Merge feature into `dev`
- Merge `dev` into `main` for release
- Merge `main` back into `dev` if hotfix applied to production
- Always use `git fetch` + `merge` when syncing main into dev
- Prefer using GitHub Pull Request for main merges
